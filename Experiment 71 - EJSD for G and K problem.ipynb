    "The aim of this Experiment is to run something like Experiment 62 and 67, where we create a grid of ESJD values for different values of $\\delta$ and different values of $\\alpha$, for a series of $\\epsilon$s, to figure out if larger $\\alpha$s are required to explore filamentary distributions with very small $\\epsilon$. We do this in the context of the G and K distribution to see if $\\alpha$ large is still required in high-dimensions and \"non-trivial\" manifolds, where by trivial we mean the ellipse, which seems to have somewhat constant curvature.\n"
