# Manifold Sampling
Algorithms, Ideas and Notes of Sampling from a Manifold. 



- Sampling from a manifold in a reversible and efficient manner. 
- Using manifold-sampling techniques to sample along the contour of a distribution and developing methods for hopping between different level sets. For instance HMC.
- Possible connections to the manifold defined by a simulator with latent variables in ABC.
